# ASD-model

Automatically generated Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and neurotypical control genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). ASD_model_fva and Control_model_fva models are the constrained versions of ASD_model and Control_model with loopless flux variability analysis (FVA) minimum and maximum values, if possible.
